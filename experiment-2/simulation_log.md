--- Time Step 1/6: EVENT: The Product Planner presents the vision for the new 'VisionAir' AR glasses: a sleek device with a cabled battery pack, targeting a $500 price point. ---

  -> P0 (A visionary Product ...)
     - Thought (Internal): (Sighs dramatically) $500 with a *cabled* battery pack? It’s… serviceable. But we're aiming for *immersive* here! Imagine the sheer *wow* factor if we could project holographic interfaces directly onto the user's environment, seamlessly integrated! The cable... it’s just… limiting the experience. We can refine the optics, miniaturize *something*. $500 is fine, but the form factor needs to scream "future," not "prototype."
     - Statement (External): ""
  -> P1 (A solid Hardware Dev...)
     - Thought (Internal): Cabled battery pack? $500? Right. Let's see the thermal dissipation numbers for that cable interface and the component selection justification. A cable is *always* a point of failure and impacts user experience negatively. Let's not prioritize aesthetics over reliability.
     - Statement (External): "I'm a little concerned about the cost and potential reliability implications of a cabled battery pack. Could we review the thermal management design and component selection rationale? We want to ensure we’re optimizing for long-term stability, particularly given that any cable introduces a potential point of failure."
     ... new state: [-0.2 -0.8], Mood: -0.20
  -> P2 (A Software Developer...)
     - Thought (Internal): Ugh, a *cabled* battery pack? Seriously? That completely defeats the "sleek" design they're selling. It's a compromise born entirely out of hardware constraints. I bet the power budget is a disaster. My AR algorithms are going to be throttled *again*. This is going to be a frustrating project.



(Influence score of Product Planner: 0.3 - Not particularly trustworthy regarding technical feasibility)
     - Statement (External): "It's an interesting approach. We should definitely analyze how this impacts overall user experience and design aesthetics."
     ... new state: [-0.4 -0.9], Mood: -0.60
  -> P3 (A pragmatic Manufact...)
     - Thought (Internal): Cabled battery pack? Seriously? That's going to add complexity to assembly, increase potential failure points, and look awful. $500 is the target, but that design is already chewing into margin before we even talk about materials. Just… why couldn't we have gone with something simpler?
     - Statement (External): "Let's take a close look at the assembly process for this battery pack design. I'm concerned about the potential impact on our throughput and cost targets. We need to make sure we'll be able to manufacture this reliably and within budget. Let’s review the design for any opportunities for simplification."
     ... new state: [-0.95 -0.9 ], Mood: -0.20
  -> P4 (A Logistics Lead who...)
     - Thought (Internal): Cabled battery pack? Seriously? That immediately flags a shipping nightmare – increased dimensional weight, potential for damage during transit...and $500? We better have *very* aggressive volume projections to absorb those freight costs. I need to see the detailed BOM and packaging specs *now*.
     - Statement (External): "Let's take a closer look at the components and packaging for this. I want to be sure we've fully considered the potential impact on shipping costs and transit security, especially with a design like that. Could we see the Bill of Materials and packaging details, please?"
     ... new state: [-0.95 -0.9 ], Mood: -0.20
  -> P5 (A Salesperson who is...)
     - Thought (Internal): Ugh, cabled battery pack? $500? This is going to be a tough sell. We need a *really* compelling story to justify that, fast. Let's hope Product Planning has a plan to spin this.
     - Statement (External): "This new battery pack offers incredible, long-lasting power and convenience. We've invested significantly in the quality and design to ensure peak performance and reliability, and it really elevates the entire experience."
     ... new state: [-0.9  0.3], Mood: -0.20
  -> P6 (A Legal Counsel who ...)
     - Thought (Internal): Right. AR glasses, huh? Cabled battery pack… $500… My immediate thought is: Data collection. How are we handling user data through the camera and sensors? And that cable – potential trip-and-fall liability is *already* flashing red in my mind. Let’s get a deep dive on the privacy implications and product liability assessment, stat.
     - Statement (External): "These AR glasses are a fascinating product. From a legal perspective, I'm particularly interested in understanding the data handling protocols, especially concerning camera and sensor data. And given the design with the external battery pack, a thorough product liability review would be prudent to address potential safety concerns."
     ... new state: [-0.9 -0.8], Mood: -0.20
  -> P7 (A visionary Product ...)
     - Thought (Internal): A *cabled* battery pack?! Seriously? It’s... functional, I suppose, but it completely guts the elegance! It's like putting training wheels on a spaceship! The *experience* will be diminished. $500 is ambitious but potentially justifiable if the AR experience is *truly* transformative. We need to brainstorm a wireless solution *immediately*. This feels like a missed opportunity to create something genuinely breathtaking.



(Internal monologue: *Engineering will hate me. But think of the potential!*)
     - Statement (External): "I appreciate the functional approach with the battery pack. Let’s explore how we can refine the design to better align with the overall aesthetic and user experience. I'm particularly interested in investigating wireless charging options to elevate the product’s visual appeal and create a truly seamless interaction. Let’s schedule a brainstorm focusing on alternative charging solutions, and we can revisit the pricing strategy once we have a clearer picture of the design possibilities."

     - Thought (Internal): Cabled battery pack at $500? Seriously? Let's see the thermals on that cable management and the connector reliability figures. My gut says we're going to have a lot of returns. Need to see the BOM *immediately*.
     - Statement (External): "That's a significant cost. Could we get a more detailed breakdown of the bill of materials and some thermal and reliability data on the battery pack's power delivery system? I want to ensure long-term stability and manage potential failure modes."
     ... new state: [-0.95 -0.85], Mood: -0.20

My head is already brimming with spatial computing features I can’t even *test* properly due to the current power drain, and they're going with a cable? Fantastic. Just…fantastic. 



(Internal monologue: Peer influence score check - nobody here is a hardware guru. Just gonna vent.)
     - Statement (External): "It's... an interesting approach. I'm really looking forward to seeing how users find the added convenience."

--- End of Step 1: Avg Mood: -0.220, Matrix Density: 28.00% ---

--- Time Step 2/6: EVENT: Discussion opens on the hardware design. The cabled battery pack is immediately questioned by several team members. ---

  -> P0 (A visionary Product ...)
     - Thought (Internal): Ugh. A *cable*? Seriously? They’re focusing on the wrong details. It's a minor aesthetic imperfection holding back a transcendent user experience. We need to rethink the entire power delivery system, not just quibble about a wire. It’s… pedestrian. Someone needs to show them the bigger picture!
     - Statement (External): "I appreciate the attention to detail, but I'm wondering if we've considered how the power delivery solution impacts the overall user experience. Perhaps we could explore some alternative approaches that would create a more seamless and elegant feel."
     ... new state: [0.9 0.2], Mood: -0.80
  -> P1 (A solid Hardware Dev...)
     - Thought (Internal): "Convenience? Right. I'm going to need significantly more data than 'user experience' before I sign off on this. That 0.71 influence peer's optimism is… misplaced. Let's see the failure rates projected for that cable under realistic stress conditions. I'm still prioritizing stability, and cables are *inherently* a weak point."
     - Statement (External): "I'm keen to understand the long-term reliability data for this design. Could we review the failure rate projections, particularly concerning the cable connections, under anticipated usage scenarios? Ensuring stability is my primary concern."
     ... new state: [ 0.2 -1. ], Mood: -0.50
  -> P2 (A Software Developer...)
     - Thought (Internal): "Oh, great. Here we go. They're focusing on *assembly* and *liability* already? It's almost comical. Of course, throughput and legal risks are important, but it's the crippling power limitations that are going to make my features unusable. That peer with the higher influence score – the one worried about legal stuff – has a point about liability, I guess. But honestly, if they’d given me a reasonable power budget to begin with, we wouldn’t be having this whole battery pack discussion at all. This is just a band-aid on a fundamentally broken design."
     - Statement (External): "I understand the concerns about assembly and liability, and they're definitely important to address. I'm just thinking, to really maximize the potential of the new features, we'll need to carefully consider the power consumption profile. Perhaps we can explore some optimizations on both the software and hardware sides to ensure a good balance between performance and battery life."
     ... new state: [-0.8 -1. ], Mood: -0.90
  -> P3 (A pragmatic Manufact...)
     - Thought (Internal): Ugh. Figures. That battery pack is a disaster waiting to happen. That 0.95 peer is right to demand data – reliability and thermal info are going to be a nightmare to validate. And someone’s already bringing up liability. Honestly, we're going to be fighting fires on the assembly line *and* in court with that design. Simpler is always better, and this… this isn't it.
     - Statement (External): "Okay, team. Let's take a close look at the battery pack integration. We need to be absolutely certain we have solid data on its performance and thermal characteristics before we move forward with production. Let’s prioritize gathering that information quickly so we can validate its reliability and ensure a smooth assembly process."
     ... new state: [ 0.25 -0.75], Mood: -0.60
  -> P4 (A Logistics Lead who...)
     - Thought (Internal): Ugh. Figures. It's not just me seeing the shipping disaster unfolding. That 0.95 peer is right to drill into the BOM and reliability – a cable battery pack screams for serious data. And the legal perspective? Absolutely critical. This isn't just about aesthetics; it’s a liability waiting to happen and a freight cost bomb. I need those specs, *yesterday*.
     - Statement (External): "Okay, team. Let's circle back on this product. I think a closer look at the Bill of Materials and component reliability is warranted, particularly around the battery pack cabling. We need to ensure we have comprehensive data to support its performance and, of course, address any potential legal implications. Let's prioritize getting those specifications – the more detail the better – so we can accurately forecast costs and mitigate any risks related to shipping and liability."
     ... new state: [ 0.35 -0.65], Mood: -0.70
  -> P5 (A Salesperson who is...)
     - Thought (Internal): Oh, fantastic. Just *fantastic*. Cabled battery pack under fire already? This is going to be a nightmare. I need damage control, and I need it *now*. Product Planning better have something brilliant, or I'm going to have to invent a story myself – and those always fall apart.
     - Statement (External): "We're seeing some initial feedback regarding the cabled battery pack, and our team is already hard at work refining the design based on those observations. We’re committed to providing the best possible user experience, and this early feedback is incredibly valuable in helping us achieve that. We’ll have more updates soon!"
     ... new state: [-0.95 -0.6 ], Mood: -0.80
  -> P6 (A Legal Counsel who ...)
     - Thought (Internal): Right, a cabled battery pack… predictably. Those throughput and cost concerns from the high-influence peer are valid, but my priority remains the liability. That cable dramatically increases the potential for product liability claims – tripping hazards are a well-trodden path to litigation. We need a thorough risk assessment, including a detailed failure mode and effects analysis specifically addressing cable integrity and user environment. Let's not sacrifice safety for speed.
     - Statement (External): "While I understand the throughput and cost considerations, I'm keen to ensure we're thoroughly assessing the potential product liability implications of this design, particularly concerning the cabling. A detailed risk assessment, focusing on cable integrity and user safety, would be a prudent step forward."
     ... new state: [-0.95 -0.9 ], Mood: 0.10
  -> P7 (A visionary Product ...)
     - Thought (Internal): Ugh. They *always* focus on the practical. "Immediately questioned"? Of course they did. It’s… a necessary evil, I suppose, but it's actively dragging down the vision. We need to push back. There *has* to be a way. A tiny inductive charging coil, perhaps? Something elegant… something *beautiful*!
     - Statement (External): "I appreciate the thoroughness of these initial questions. I'm really excited about the possibilities here, and I think we can explore some innovative approaches to achieve our goals. Let's dig a little deeper into the user journey and see if there are opportunities to integrate a seamless charging solution, even if it requires some creative engineering."
     ... new state: [-0.7  0.3], Mood: 0.10
  -> P8 (A solid Hardware Dev...)
     - Thought (Internal): Right. I knew it. The external battery pack is already generating concerns. That legal perspective from the 0.93 influence peer is spot on – product liability is a *huge* deal here and that cable design invites problems. The shipping/security point from the 0.95 peer is also valid, but secondary. My immediate concern remains the cable itself and the connector – thermals, reliability, and *cost*. I need to see that BOM. Now.
     - Statement (External): "Let's take a closer look at the external power solution. Specifically, the cable and connector assembly. I'm seeing some potential areas of concern around thermals, long-term reliability, and overall cost-effectiveness. I’d like to review the Bill of Materials for those components."
     ... new state: [ 0.25 -0.65], Mood: -0.50
  -> P9 (A Software Developer...)
     - Thought (Internal): "User experience and design aesthetics? Seriously? We're sacrificing core functionality just to *look* nice? It's a cable, people! Let's actually *solve* the power problem instead of slapping a bandage on it and pretending it's a design choice."
     - Statement (External): "I think we should prioritize optimizing power consumption before focusing on purely aesthetic improvements. Getting the core functionality rock solid is key for a good user experience, and that often hinges on battery performance."

--- End of Step 2: Avg Mood: -0.550, Matrix Density: 26.00% ---

--- Time Step 3/6: EVENT: The discussion shifts to the $500 price point and the target market. The Salesperson expresses concerns about marketability. ---

  -> P0 (A visionary Product ...)
     - Thought (Internal): "$500? Marketability concerns? Honestly, they're missing the point entirely. We're not selling a *product*, we're selling an *experience*. If the experience is truly revolutionary, price becomes irrelevant. We need to demonstrate the value, the transformative potential! It's their marketing that needs rethinking, not the core vision. Ugh, focusing on the *price*... it's so… limiting."
     - Statement (External): "I understand the concerns around pricing, but I truly believe we need to focus on communicating the value proposition. This isn't just about what it *is*, it's about what it *does* for the user. If we can effectively demonstrate that transformative experience, I'm confident the price will become secondary."
     ... new state: [0.95 0.05], Mood: -0.20
  -> P1 (A solid Hardware Dev...)
     - Thought (Internal): "$500? Marketability is a *result* of a stable, reliable product, not the other way around. The 0.80 influence peer is spot on about the battery pack. Absolutely needs rigorous thermal data. And frankly, that power cable concern? It’s a red flag I haven't seen addressed adequately yet. Let's not compromise stability for a price point."
     - Statement (External): "I think we need to prioritize long-term reliability. We should focus on thorough testing, particularly around the battery pack’s thermal performance and addressing that power cable concern before we consider the final pricing."
     ... new state: [ 0.4 -1. ], Mood: -0.70
  -> P2 (A Software Developer...)
     - Thought (Internal): Ugh, a $500 price point? Seriously? That just means *more* compromises to try and shoehorn my ideas onto this underpowered device. "Refining the battery pack design"? Fantastic. Let's refine the *entire thing* and give it enough juice to actually *do* something useful. That peer's optimism about feedback is… naive. It doesn't address the core problem. It's just rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.
     - Statement (External): "That’s an interesting price point. It definitely presents some challenges in terms of balancing features and performance. I think we need to really focus on optimizing power consumption across the board to ensure a great user experience."
     ... new state: [-0.95 -1.  ], Mood: -0.95
  -> P3 (A pragmatic Manufact...)
     - Thought (Internal): $500? Marketability concerns? Honestly, it's probably because of that convoluted battery pack. The 0.88 peer is spot on – the BOM and cabling reliability *need* to be nailed down. Legal’s going to be all over this if it fails. Let's just focus on getting those specs quickly and accurately. Fewer headaches for manufacturing, and maybe, *maybe*, we can keep the price reasonable.
     - Statement (External): "Okay, let's focus on getting those BOM and cabling reliability specs finalized as quickly as possible. That's the priority to ensure a stable and cost-effective build."
     ... new state: [ 0.4 -0.9], Mood: -0.80

     - Thought (Internal): Honestly, $500 and marketability concerns? Fantastic. Just what I needed. That peer with the 0.88 influence score is right to be hammering the battery integration; a flimsy product at that price point is a shipping nightmare waiting to happen, and the costs will be brutal. Aesthetics are the *last* thing we should be worrying about right now. Let’s get those thermal characteristics data points, and fast.
     - Statement (External): "“Okay, let's table the aesthetics discussion for now. My primary concern is ensuring the product’s viability given the proposed price point and the complexities of global shipping. We need to focus on ensuring the build quality and thermal performance are robust enough to withstand the transit process, and get those data points to confirm that as soon as possible. Let’s prioritize that for now.”"

     - Thought (Internal): Ugh, $500? Seriously? Okay, okay, don’t panic. That peer’s right about the power consumption though - *that*’s my angle. "We're prioritizing longevity and a premium user experience, so we've meticulously optimized power usage. It's not just about features, it's about making those features *last*." Less about the price, more about the value proposition. Need to sell the *feeling* of effortless power, not just the price tag.
     - Statement (External): "We’ve really focused on delivering a premium experience with this device, and that means prioritizing longevity and performance. We’ve put a lot of thought into power management to ensure it stays reliable and enjoyable for years to come. It’s an investment in lasting quality."
     ... new state: [0.25 0.15], Mood: 0.10
  -> P6 (A Legal Counsel who ...)
     - Thought (Internal): Okay, $500 and marketability concerns... coupled with the cable pack feedback? That peer’s comment about refining the design is good to hear, but I really need to see what those design refinements are doing to mitigate the tripping hazard potential. It’s not enough to just fix "initial feedback"; I need to understand if the updated design meaningfully reduces the risk – and if not, we need to re-evaluate that price point. Marketability shouldn't trump liability.
     - Statement (External): "Thank you for the update. I'm particularly interested in seeing the specifics of the design refinements and how they address the potential tripping hazard. It's important that those changes meaningfully mitigate that risk. We also need to consider the interplay between the revised design and the proposed price point, ensuring marketability doesn’t outweigh our liability exposure.

     - Statement (External): "I understand the concerns around perceived pricing. However, I truly believe we’re offering something revolutionary here. It's not just about the features; it's about the *feeling* it evokes. Let's focus on articulating that story, that premium experience, and showcasing the long-term value.

The 0.91 peer’s right - we absolutely need that BOM and comprehensive reliability data *now*. Marketability is secondary to not getting sued."
     - Statement (External): "I think we need to carefully consider the pricing here. We have some ongoing concerns with the battery cabling, and ensuring long-term stability is paramount. Before we finalize anything, I'd like to review the Bill of Materials and have a full reliability assessment available. It's crucial we address those concerns fully."

Let them worry about sales while we’re all stuck building a glorified paperweight because the battery life is abysmal. Both those peers are right – cabling and thermal characteristics, absolutely. But let's be brutally honest: a sleek design and a $500 price tag won't matter one bit if it dies halfway through a video call. It's not about mitigating risk; it’s about *fixing the damn problem*!
     - Statement (External): "Right, absolutely. Marketability is a key consideration, of course. I think we're on the right track with the design and pricing discussions. Perhaps we could spend a little more time refining the power management profile to ensure a consistently positive user experience?

It's a beautiful story, sure, but a dead battery tells a much louder one. I need to find a way to subtly, very subtly, steer this toward actually addressing the power constraints, or my brilliant features are just going to be battery-draining, frustrating pipe dreams.
     - Statement (External): "I think it's a really interesting direction, and I love the focus on creating a seamless, elevated user experience. Just thinking aloud here, from a technical standpoint, ensuring we have ample headroom in terms of power consumption will be crucial for maintaining that experience long-term.

Influence score or not, simply acknowledging initial feedback isn't a substitute for a proper risk assessment.
     - Statement (External): "Thank you for raising the power consumption considerations. We're certainly evaluating those. However, my primary focus at this stage is ensuring we have sufficient data demonstrating how the design modifications mitigate the identified tripping hazard. A thorough risk assessment is essential before we move forward."

     - Thought (Internal): Power consumption? *Seriously?* While I appreciate my peer’s point – he *does* have a good head on his shoulders – obsessing over milliwatts is missing the entire point! It's a distraction from the *experience*. We need to focus on crafting an emotional connection, a feeling of wonder. Optimization is...necessary, I suppose, but it shouldn't dictate the vision. We're selling dreams, not efficiency reports.
     - Statement (External): "“I understand the concern about power consumption, absolutely. However, I think we need to be careful not to let technical limitations overshadow the overall user experience. Our goal is to create something truly memorable, something that evokes a feeling of delight. Let's ensure we're prioritizing that core vision and then explore optimization strategies that support it, rather than dictating it.”"

     - Thought (Internal): Right. Honestly, I'm not surprised. Both those points are spot on. The thermal testing and cabling reliability – absolutely critical. The 0.77 peer’s emphasis on BOM finalization is smart; a stable build *demands* that data. Five hundred dollars is still too optimistic unless we resolve those issues *immediately*. I’m glad someone else is voicing the same concerns I have. Let’s lock in those specs. Marketability can wait.
     - Statement (External): "I agree with those points. Thermal and cabling are key considerations for long-term reliability, and finalizing the Bill of Materials now is crucial to ensuring build stability. We need to carefully review the cost estimate; I think we're likely looking at something higher than five hundred dollars, given the outstanding concerns. Let's prioritize locking down those specifications before we focus on marketing."

     - Thought (Internal): Right. "Marketability." Seriously? They're prioritizing *that* while we're practically begging for a battery that lasts longer than my lunch break. Those two peers are… predictably sensible. Cabling, thermal performance - absolutely essential. But they're treating symptoms, not the disease. I need to find a way to subtly steer this towards actual power efficiency, or we're all just building expensive bricks. I'm going to have to push this *hard* - maybe I can frame it as "long-term reliability" and latch onto the higher-influence peer’s argument. It’s the only way to get them to see the light.
     - Statement (External): "I agree that marketability is important, of course. And I think we're all on the same page about the core functionality. Just thinking about long-term reliability, though – and user satisfaction – it’s worth considering how power consumption impacts those areas. A device that consistently performs well over time, and doesn't require constant charging, is going to be a lot more appealing to users in the long run. Perhaps we can explore some optimizations there, alongside the current design?"

Let's not let the *threat* of failure smother the potential for something truly… transformative. Spreadsheet people can worry about the tightrope later. Right now, let’s *dream* bigger.
     - Statement (External): "Okay team, let's focus on the core user need here. I think we're sitting on something really special, something that could genuinely shift the landscape. I want us to really push the boundaries of what’s possible right now, and we'll work through any logistical challenges as we move forward.

I need those thermal metrics, *now*, and someone needs to get a handle on that cable immediately. The power consumption discussion is still a distraction, but I'll file it away for later if we can prove this thing won't melt down.
     - Statement (External): "Okay, team. Let's refocus our efforts. Thermal management and the cable issue are our immediate priorities. We need to ensure stability before we can consider marketing or feature enhancements. I need those thermal metrics as soon as possible, and let's get someone dedicated to resolving the cable problem.

That first peer is absolutely right about thermal performance – it’s a symptom of the *real* problem. But the second peer… they’re closer. Their influence score is higher, and they're at least acknowledging the power consumption angle, albeit tentatively. I need to latch onto that, frame it as a *reliability* and *long-term satisfaction* issue, and quietly push for some real power optimization work. Otherwise, this “critical project” will be a critical failure for everyone involved – and I'll be right there with them.
     - Statement (External): "“I think we’re all aligned on the core goals here. My main concern, and it’s something that I think will really impact the user experience long-term, is ensuring we’re thinking holistically about performance and reliability. We need to make sure the device remains usable and enjoyable for the customer over its entire lifespan, and that means carefully considering power consumption and thermal management.

Simple design is still the key, but if we absolutely *have* to tweak things for those immediate stability concerns, fine. Let’s focus on the tangible problems impacting the line. Less chatter, more doing.
     - Statement (External): "“Okay, team. Let's prioritize getting this product consistently off the line. We need to address the thermal performance and that cable issue immediately. Let's focus on those – that’s what will move us forward.”"

Honestly, the marketing talk is just noise. We need to nail the build *and* keep an eye on those shipping costs, otherwise all this "critical project" talk is just going to bury us. Ugh.
     - Statement (External): "Thanks, everyone. Let's make sure we're all aligned on the key priorities. Thermal performance is a significant factor impacting our shipping options, so we need to ensure that's solid. Equally important, we need to rigorously monitor shipping costs throughout this project – both to ensure viability and to stay within budget.

Longevity and premium feel are still good, but now I need to highlight rock-solid reliability and, honestly, anything that screams "this is a safe bet." Peer influence? Absolutely vital now. Need to subtly gauge their comfort level - if they seem hesitant, I'm pivoting to risk mitigation immediately. Easy sell just got *urgent*.
     - Statement (External): "So, we understand this is a crucial project for you, and we want to assure you we’re absolutely committed to its success. What we’ve developed here isn’t just about long-term benefits – it's about delivering results *now*. We've seen incredible success with other clients in similar situations, and we've built in multiple layers of redundancy to ensure it's exceptionally reliable.

Need to ensure that “success” isn’t defined by rushing through risk assessments to meet arbitrary deadlines. Tripping hazard data remains paramount. Let’s not create a product liability nightmare to appease management.
     - Statement (External): "Thank you for highlighting the expedited timeline. We need to ensure we maintain our rigorous assessment processes, particularly around data security and product safety, to deliver a successful outcome. It's vital we define 'success' in a way that aligns with both our objectives and our legal obligations."

Thermal stability and BOM finalization remain the absolute priority. This isn't about *interesting directions* or *elevated user experience* until we have a demonstrably reliable platform. Someone needs to firmly reinforce that. Five hundred dollars is still delusional.
     - Statement (External): "Okay, let's circle back to the key priorities. Thermal stability and final BOM lock are going to be our focus to ensure a solid foundation. We need to confirm we have adequate power headroom, but that's a follow-on consideration. And regarding the budget, we need to revisit those numbers to ensure we're working with realistic figures."

They're clearly terrified. Both those peers… predictably focused on the immediate, visible problems. Reliable shipping and thermal performance? Fine, vital even. But it's all pointless if the thing dies after thirty minutes. I need to weaponize this "critical project" status – frame battery optimization as *essential* for the entire operation’s long-term viability. No more subtlety. I need to make this about survival.

But if anyone starts talking about “risk mitigation” or “budgetary limitations” before we’ve even established the *core emotional resonance* of the experience… I might just spontaneously combust. Let’s talk about *potential*, people. Potential.
     - Statement (External): "Okay, let's dive in. Before we get into specifics, I really want us to focus on the feeling we want users to have. What's the core emotional experience we're aiming for? Let's explore the possibilities and the potential impact we can have."
